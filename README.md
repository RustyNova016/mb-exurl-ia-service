## About

The project is a rust based service which utilizes Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) APIs to preserve URLs present in Musicbrainz database, in Internet Archive history.
MusicBrainz database sees a lot of edits made on a daily basis. With each edit, thereâ€™s associated an edit note which provides additional information about the edit. Often, these edit notes, as well as some edits, contain external links, which we want to archive in the Internet Archive.
